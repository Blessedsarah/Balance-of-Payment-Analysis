## Key Insights
### Albania

- There was a surplus in Albania's Capital Account with a sharp increase in 2021. This was due to the capital account credits exceeding the capital account debits. And this indicates that more capital is flowing into the country than going out. 
- Albania experienced a Current Account Deficit. The deficit results from a negative balance on goods and services, as the imports exceed exports significantly. While primary income (like earnings on investments) and secondary income (such as remittances) are positive, they are insufficient to offset the trade deficit.
- Financial Account Deficit: This deficit is driven by negative contributions from direct investment and other investments, with consistent downward trends. These components suggest that more money is leaving Albania through investments than coming in, leading to a net outflow of financial resources.
### Austria

- Austria experienced a defcit in her Capital Account but a Surplus in 2023. The consistent deficit over the years is attributed to high capital account debits, indicating outflows of capital. In 2023, there was a surplus, where credits surpassed debits, marking a shift towards a net inflow of capital.
- Current Account Surplus (Deficit in 2022). The primary contributor to the surplus is the balance of goods and services, where exports exceed imports. In 2022, the deficit in the balance of goods and services led to a current account deficit, possibly due to increased imports or a decline in export performance.
- Financial Account Surplus (Deficit in 2022). The surplus arises from positive portfolio investments and other investments, indicating a net inflow of financial resources. In 2022, there was a deficit caused by negative other investments, meaning outflows in this segment exceeded inflows.
